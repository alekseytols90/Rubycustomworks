Dear <%= @person.name %>,

To confirm your intention to change your email address in the BIRS database to
<%= @replace_with_email %>, and thereby merge all of the data (such as workshop
memberships) from the <%= @person.email %> record into the <%= @replace_with_email %>
record, please enter the following code into the form you were shown:

Verification code for <%= @person.email %>: <%= @verification_code %>

You will also need to verify that you control the <%= @replace_with_email %>
account by entering the code sent to that address.

If you did not request this change of your email, please reply to this message
to let us know.

Thank you,
Banff International Research Station
