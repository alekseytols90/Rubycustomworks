Dear <%= @person.name %>,

To confirm your intention to change your email address in the BIRS database to
<%= @replace_with_email %>, and thereby merge all of the data from the
<%= @person.email %> record into the <%= @replace_with_email %> record, please
visit the following link:

<%= @email_confirmation_link %>

You will also need to verify that you control the <%= @replace_with_email %>
account by visiting a link sent to that address.

If you did not request this change of your email, please do NOT follow the link
and reply to this message to let us know.

Thank you,
