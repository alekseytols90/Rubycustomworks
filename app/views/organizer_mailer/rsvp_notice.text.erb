Dear <%= @organizer.dear_name %>,

There has been a change in membership for the event:
<%= @event.code %>: <%= @event.name %>
<%= @event.dates %>

The change was:
"<%= @member.name %>" <<%= @member.email %>> (<%= @member.affiliation %>)
was "<%= @old_attendance %>", and is now "<%= @new_attendance %>".

<% unless @message_to_organizer.blank? %>
<%= @member.firstname %> included this message:
"<%= @message_to_organizer %>"

<% end %>
You may view the Confirmed members here:
<%= @membership_url %>

If you login (register at https://workshops.birs.ca/register), you would see all workshop members and their current attendance status.
