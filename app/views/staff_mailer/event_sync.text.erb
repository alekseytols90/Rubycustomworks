Dear Program Coordinator,

There are errors in the <%= @event.code %> (<%= @event.location %>) event data:

<%= @error_messages %>

As a result of these errors, the organizers will not see the above participants in Workshops.

Please update the data as soon as possible, so the organizers can work with it (i.e., schedule talks).

Many thanks!
